# Data-Analysis-Project-Sales-Analysis

Project Overview
Goal: The primary objective is to showcase the process of exploring and analyzing a dataset. This includes data cleaning, transformation, and visualization to uncover insights.
Data: (Optional) If you used a specific dataset, describe it here (e.g., “This project uses a movie ratings dataset from Kaggle” or a public CSV file).
Outcome: By following this tutorial, you’ll learn how to:
Load data into a Pandas DataFrame
Clean and preprocess the dataset (handle missing values, duplicates, etc.)
Generate summary statistics
Visualize important trends and distributions
Draw insights from the data for reporting or further analysis.

Features
Data Cleaning: Handling missing/incorrect data, removing duplicates, and normalizing formats.
Exploratory Analysis: Using descriptive statistics and Pandas functionality to understand the dataset.
Visualization: Creating charts and plots (line charts, histograms, bar plots, etc.) with Matplotlib or Seaborn.
Reporting: Presenting key findings that can guide decision-making or further research.


Technologies Used:
Python 3.x
Pandas – for data manipulation
NumPy – for numerical operations
Matplotlib / Seaborn – for data visualization
Jupyter Notebook (optional) – for interactive development.
